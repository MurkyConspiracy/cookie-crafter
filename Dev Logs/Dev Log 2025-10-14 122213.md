```Dev Log Thoughts

Created an init repo, and this here MD vault!
I am excited to get working on this project.

I have decided I want to make something related to crafting gameplay and with the game jam restrictions I am thinking chistmas cookie crafting/resource collection game.

I am excited for cookie types as bases. This is going to take heavy inspiration from Diablo II and the socketing mechanic.
